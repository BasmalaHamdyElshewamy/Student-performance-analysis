# Student-performance-analysis
The dashboard demonstrates a high overall student success rate of approximately 90%, yet analysis uncovers significant performance disparities influenced by social and educational factors. Female students generally achieve higher success than males, except in reading, where males perform slightly better, reflecting different learning tendencies across genders. Students who complete test preparation courses and have access to standard lunch programs show noticeably higher success, highlighting the role of structured academic support and economic stability. Parental education also correlates strongly with student outcomes, emphasizing the impact of family engagement on learning.

Subject-level insights reveal that math performance is particularly sensitive to structured preparation, with failures concentrated among students lacking exam readiness. Writing success follows a similar pattern, although overall results remain strong. Reading achieves the highest pass rates, yet gaps persist among students without early literacy support, indicating that sustained engagement, rather than last-minute preparation, is key for this subject. Socio-economic factors consistently influence performance across all areas, with students on free or reduced lunch plans lagging behind.

These findings suggest targeted strategies to enhance equity and overall achievement. Expanding test preparation and academic support programs, particularly in math and writing, can help address subject-specific challenges. Early literacy initiatives and access to reading resources for economically disadvantaged students could improve reading outcomes. Strengthening family and social support, alongside academic interventions, may further reduce gaps and ensure all students have the resources needed to succeed.

Overall, the dashboard underscores the importance of combining academic preparation, socio-economic support, and family engagement to sustain high success rates while addressing disparities across student populations and subjects. By prioritizing at-risk groups and implementing evidence-based interventions, schools can promote more equitable and consistent learning outcomes.
